## Story:
Once a day, you woke up, and found yourself in a maze with an electronic heart instead of the natural one, then, a robot comes to you and tells you have been put into tests, you have to finish each level to recharge your heart before it runs out of power.

This is my first Ludum Dare Jam game ever, I had some problems managing my time, and here's what I came with.

I hope you enjoy it :)

## About LIKO-12

The game has been made using LIKO-12, an opensource fantasy computer made using the LÃ–VE framework, and actually it's using a modified version that has Audio support, it loads the wav and ogg files in the Audio folder, give them ids, and then in the game I call "Music(id)", "SFX(id)" and "StopAudio()", I will write a devblog soon telling about all the modifications I made while creating this game.
